This code provides a comprehensive layout with a carousel that displays images, a fixed header with a navigation bar, sections for content, and event cards. It includes styles for responsive design, animations, and interactive elements like hover effects.

Key Features:
Global Reset & Body Styling: The * selector resets margins and paddings across the page, while the body sets the font and background color.
Header & Navigation: A fixed header with a logo and a navigation menu, styled to stay on top and provide ease of access across the site.
Carousel:
The carousel container is centered, with arrows for navigation on both sides.
Images in the carousel pop out when active, and adjacent images transition smoothly using transform and scale animations.
The carousel is designed to ensure the center image is larger and more prominent.
Section Layouts: Each section is styled for clear text display, with margins and paddings for readability.
Responsive Design: Uses media queries to adjust styles for smaller screens, ensuring usability on mobile devices.
Event & Organizer Cards: These cards have hover effects that enlarge and add shadows for a modern, interactive feel.
Additional Components:
A preloader using a background GIF.
Sidebar menu for mobile or smaller screen navigation.
Dialog boxes for user interactions, with overlay effects.
The combination of animations, flexbox layout, and hover effects ensures a clean, modern look with smooth interactions across devices.
